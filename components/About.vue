              We are a team of expatriates living in Germany, and who have also
              had to face the
              <strong class="text-blue-600">cumbersome bureaucracy</strong>
              behind every step of the immigration process.
              <strong class="text-blue-600"
                >We have practically gone through it all</strong
              >â€“from applying for student permits, to getting a Blue Card for
              working here, all the way to obtaining the German citizenship.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-blueGray-400">
              Our goal with EasyXpat is to
              <strong class="text-blue-600">simplify</strong> the German
              immigration process as much as posssible for other expatriates
              like us. Simply put, our end mission is to make the process of
              jumping between poorly-designed regional government websites, with
              information written in
              <strong class="text-blue-600">confusing legalese German</strong>,
              a thing of the past.

              While we cannot support you with your specific legal case

                any legal or immigration services or advice)</strong

              on the right path when living as an expat in Germany.

              Whether you are just freshly arriving to Germany for your new job,

              few years, we want to provide you with all the information you
              need to
              <strong class="text-blue-600">successfully apply</strong> for your
